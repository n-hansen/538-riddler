simulation for 6/23/17 riddler: the coffee pot contest

single-run-results.svg shows the average coffee/turn for a 300 player corpus, over 8e10 total turns. single-run-results-zoom.svg trims players to those who attempt to take at least 0.4 of the pot.

multi-run-results.svg shows the results of an iterated version of the game, where player strategies are resampled each run, with higher weights given to those who perform better. in that simulation, 100 players are used and 1e10 turns are taken. again, multi-run-results.svg trims the plot to players who take at least 0.4 of the pot.
